## 🚀 Ready-to-Use Builds (Recommended)

**You do NOT need to compile anything if you just want to use the aimbot!**  
Precompiled `.exe` builds are available for both **DirectML** (Universal support for all GPUs) and **CUDA** (High-performance for NVIDIA GPUs).

---

### ⚡ DirectML (DML) Build — Universal (All GPUs)

* **Compatibility:**
  * **Works with:** Any modern GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, including integrated graphics)
  * **Supports:** Windows 10/11 (x64)
  * **No need for CUDA or special drivers** — works out of the box on any compatible GPU
* **Recommended for:**
  * Older NVIDIA cards like GTX 10xx/9xx/7xx
  * AMD Radeon or Intel Iris/Xe GPUs
  * Laptops and office PCs with integrated graphics

---

### 🚀 CUDA + TensorRT Build — High Performance (NVIDIA Only)

* **Compatibility:**
  * **Works with:** NVIDIA GPUs (GTX 1660, RTX 2000/3000/4000 series, or newer)
  * **Requires:** CUDA 12.8 and TensorRT 10.8 (both included in the build)
  * **Supports:** Windows 10/11 (x64)
* **Limitations:**
  * Not supported on older NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., GTX 10xx/Pascal series) due to TensorRT 10 limitations
  * Includes both CUDA+TensorRT and DirectML support — switchable in settings
